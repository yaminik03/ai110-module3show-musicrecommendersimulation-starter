# 🎧 Model Card: Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name  

Give your model a short, descriptive name.  
Example: **VibeFinder 1.0**  

---

## 2. Intended Use  

Describe what your recommender is designed to do and who it is for. 

Prompts:  

- What kind of recommendations does it generate  
- What assumptions does it make about the user  
- Is this for real users or classroom exploration  

---

## 3. How the Model Works  

Explain your scoring approach in simple language.  

Prompts:  

- What features of each song are used (genre, energy, mood, etc.)  
- What user preferences are considered  
- How does the model turn those into a score  
- What changes did you make from the starter logic  

Avoid code here. Pretend you are explaining the idea to a friend who does not program.

## 4. Data  

Describe the dataset the model uses.  

Prompts:  

- How many songs are in the catalog  
- What genres or moods are represented  
- Did you add or remove data  
- Are there parts of musical taste missing in the dataset  

---

## 5. Strengths  

Where does your system seem to work well  

Prompts:  

- User types for which it gives reasonable results  
- Any patterns you think your scoring captures correctly  
- Cases where the recommendations matched your intuition  

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias 

Where the system struggles or behaves unfairly. 

Prompts:  

- Features it does not consider  
- Genres or moods that are underrepresented  
- Cases where the system overfits to one preference  
- Ways the scoring might unintentionally favor some users  

The system shows a clear weakness in how strongly it relies on energy proximity, especially after doubling its weight during the experiment. This causes high-energy songs to dominate the top recommendations, even when genre or mood preferences suggest otherwise. As a result, the model can form an “energy bias,” where users with extreme energy settings receive less diverse and more repetitive suggestions. Additionally, because genre matching is exact rather than fuzzy, similar styles may be excluded unnecessarily. Overall, the system prioritizes a few strong signals too heavily, reducing balance and diversity in the rankings.

## 7. Evaluation  

How you checked whether the recommender behaved as expected. 

Prompts:  

- Which user profiles you tested  
- What you looked for in the recommendations  
- What surprised you  
- Any simple tests or comparisons you ran  

No need for numeric metrics unless you created some.

I tested the recommender using different user profiles, including High-Energy Pop, Chill Lofi, and an Intense/Conflicted profile with mixed preferences. The goal was to see if the system could adapt recommendations to different listening styles and return songs that match each user’s vibe.

I checked whether the top results made sense for each profile and whether certain songs were being overused across different users. Overall, the system worked well for clear preferences, with songs like "SUNRISE CITY" and "LIBRARY RAIN" appearing in the expected contexts.

One surprising result was that “Gym Hero” appeared in many different profiles, even when users were not specifically looking for workout-style music. This happened because energy had a strong influence on the scoring.

I also noticed that in conflicting profiles, the system tended to favor energy over mood, which reduced variety in recommendations.

## 8. Future Work  

Ideas for how you would improve the model next.  

Prompts:  

- Additional features or preferences  
- Better ways to explain recommendations  
- Improving diversity among the top results  
- Handling more complex user tastes

## 9. Personal Reflection  

A few sentences about your experience.  

Prompts:  

- What you learned about recommender systems  
- Something unexpected or interesting you discovered  
- How this changed the way you think about music recommendation apps
